# AndroidMVP
Testable Android sample app with MVP pattern + Mockito + Robolectric

Currently, this sample demonstrates testable components including:
- Presenter
- RecyclerView's ViewHolder

Also, this sample proposes a solution to preserve nested RecyclerView's state (mostly scroll position of horizontal RecyclerView inside vertical RecyclerView, even when the horizontal RecyclerView is recycled as an item inside the vertical one) through rotation changes and scrolling.
